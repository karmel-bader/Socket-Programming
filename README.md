Socket programming is a method of enabling communication between two or more devices over a 
network. It involves creating endpoints (sockets) that allow data to be sent and received over the network. 
This project focuses on understanding and implementing basic concepts of socket programming using 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), The project also requires familiarity with basic HTML and web server concepts. This involves 
understanding how to serve HTML pages over the network using a web server, which listens for HTTP 
requests and responds with appropriate content, such as web pages, images, or files.
